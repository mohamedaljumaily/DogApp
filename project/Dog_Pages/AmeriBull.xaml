                            American Bulldogs are healthy dogs and will do very well with a variety of quality dog foods. 
American Bulldog puppies should be fed a large-breed puppy food for the first 14 months of their life in order to ensure slow and steady growth. 
Puppies should not be fed added calcium until they are advanced to adult food.
Adult dogs should be fed a quality large-breed food along with added supplements for joint, muscle and coat care.

                            Grooming your American Bulldog can be a pretty easy task. 
This breed does not need to be bathed often, only occasional baths when they become dirty. 
Regular brushing will help keep their coat clean and shiny. 
Their nails should be trimmed every few weeks and ears should be cleaned once a month or as needed. 
Their teeth should be brushed regularly. Seasonal shedding is to be expected.

                            Early socialization and puppy training classes are vital in channeling the American Bulldog’s energy.
Rules and routines should be put in place early and adhered to as dogs grow up. 
They require a firm but loving hand to establish and retain proper boundaries. 
The more exposure to good training practices, other dogs, and people, the more likely the success at being managed both inside and outside of their environment.
